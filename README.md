# DeepSuccin
DeepSuccin : Prediction of protein succinylation sites with deep learning model. 
# Requirement
  Backend = Tensorflow <br/>
  Keras <br/>
  Numpy <br/>
  Biopython <br/>
  Sklearn <br/>
  Imblearn <br/>
  Matplotlib <br/>
 # Dataset
 Dataset is in FASTA format which includes protein window size of 33. Test dataset is provided.
 # Model
 The best model has been included -> model.h5
 # Prediction for given test dataset
 With all the prerequisite installed, run -> model_load.py
 # Prediction for your dataset
 The format should be same as the test dataset which is basically FASTA format. This model works for window size 33 only.
